🌍 Matching Logic (Backend Concept)

// Sample matching logic
const matchBuyers = async (req, res) => {
  const { cropName, farmerLocation } = req.body;
  const buyers = await User.find({ role: 'buyer' });
  const nearby = buyers.filter(buyer =>
    getDistance(farmerLocation, buyer.location) < 50
  );
  res.json(nearby);
};
